Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets
What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.
Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.
Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

What are we looking for?
We are looking for a Data Engineer with an ownership mindset where they can take a challenging data problem all the way through to an elegant tech solution that is robust and scalable. Someone who prides themselves on not only writing efficient code, but also in creating intuitive dashboards and data flows with clear and easy to read documentation.

This type of ownership will provide incredible opportunities for personal and professional growth. You will have ample technical and team leadership opportunities, depending on your interests.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,Microsoft,"Montréal, QC",,/rc/clk?jk=b46191daec11e573&fccid=734cb5a01ee60f80&vjs=3,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.
