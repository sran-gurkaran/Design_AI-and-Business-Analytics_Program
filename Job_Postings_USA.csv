Research Scientist (roles across multiple teams),Neo Cybernetica,"Remote in Boston, MA",,/rc/clk?jk=c03f5a9e4958d172&fccid=94d73538b312c3a6&vjs=3,"About Us
We are a next-gen cybernetics start-up backed by top-tier investors (Our seed round led by NEA).
Our work focuses on the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and simulation. We aim to push the boundaries of what intelligent systems are capable of. We're interested both in cases of autonomous operation, and in cases of human-collaborative operation. Our organization operates at the frontier of human capabilities, working actively to advance them and meaningfully improve the state of robotics and human society at large.
About the Role
By applying to this role, you will be considered for Research Scientist Positions across all roles at Neo Cybernetica, you will be responsible for doing the impossible.
You will be working at the bleeding edge of embodied intelligence with a world-class team spanning artificial intelligence, robotics, and simulation. You will be surrounded by experts from diverse backgrounds and work side-by-side to take The Next Step in Artificial Intelligence.
We believe that modern deep learning systems are amazing tools. Problems of perception and language modeling that were impossible just years ago are now trivial. Foundation models, novel supervision strategies, and multimodal techniques have fundamentally redefined the space of what is possible.
Our mission is to assemble and extend these technologies into the real world. As an organization, we are engineers first and foremost, but realize that often the most interesting and challenging research arises when theory meets reality. Our research scientists are the tip of the spear - breaking new ground through which the rest of the organization can follow.

Below are the four current areas that we are focused on:
Grounded Generation (3D reconstruction). From text to image to audio data, generative AI has advanced dramatically in the past several years. We believe that the next step in this journey is grounded generation. Specifically the ability to condition generative models on top of structured, explicit data as well as complex objectives such as multi-view spatio-temporal coherence and part deconstruction. We are specifically interested in this problem as it applies to 3D reconstruction.
The Grounded Generation position is meant for someone with a deep and specific expertise in this subject. Ideally you should have a PhD in a relevant niche and some industry experience - coupled with a deep mathematical background and general AI proficiency.
Imitation Learning. In a field that is characterized by so many different supervision schemes that it's almost impossible to list them all, imitation learning stands out as a unique field. We believe that there is particular value in learning to replicate unmapped action spaces as chains of differentiable operators.
The Imitation Learning position is meant for someone with a deep and specific expertise in this subject. Ideally you should have a PhD in a relevant niche and some industry experience - coupled with a deep mathematical background and general AI proficiency.
Physics-Informed Priors. Most modern foundation models are made with generality in mind. Made to incorporate minimal priors such that the same model can be applied to Atari and yodeling and angst teen journaling. We have a different approach: specifically building our models to function in the real world; where energy is conserved, space-time is coherent, and walls can't be hacked.
By Physics standards The Physics-Informed Priors position is meant for someone with middling physics and math skills - ideally with a focus on things like non-linear dynamics, elasticity, or statistical mechanics - and strong AI skills. By AI standards, this position is for someone with strong math and physics skills and middling AI skills. No PhD required, but some level of industry experience in or adjacent to AI is expected.
Communication. If a breakthrough is never cited, was it really a breakthrough? We believe that one of the most important, and under-emphasized aspects of research is its communication with a broader audience. This includes ad-hoc evaluation and analysis on new research and directed requests to communicate complex topics to technical audiences.
The Communication position is an entry-level position meant for someone that is extremely eager to learn about a broad range of subjects in AI. We don't require any industry experience or a particular depth in any specific subject. Instead communication skills such as writing and art coupled with strong AI fundamentals and a strong desire to learn are the core attributes that will make someone successful in this role.

We believe that the culture of a research organization is important. There are many different philosophies and approaches to making progress here. Ours is to focus maniacally on multi-disciplinary work and redefining problem statements to take advantage of the flexibility afforded to private industry. These are the core attributes that we look for across all of these roles to ensure success:
Humility. Our goal, as an organization, is to surround you with brilliant people. Nobody will be the smartest person in the room and we endeavor to build a research team that will thrive in that environment.
Pragmatism. The path to hell is paved with good intentions. There are simply too many fascinating problems in our space. We believe the core to navigating these incredible opportunities and research directions is with relentless pragmatism. What is the cheapest test we can run? What is the simplest approach to a problem that might work? What are the problems that we can push to tomorrow?
Open-mindedness. We are building this impossible. That means, by definition, that nobody knows how to do the things that we are attempting. We are all wrong, and in a handful of months we will all look like fools. Only by embracing that can we make progress.
If the above resonates with you, we would love to hear from you. At Neo Cybernetica we plan on accomplishing some truly incredible things and are looking for people just crazy enough to come along for the journey. I can earnestly say to everybody reading this: I hope you are one of those people.
I hope you're one of the crazy ones."

Role Summary & Background

We utilize our data and analytics capabilities to turbocharge our campaigns for change. Our electoral campaigns, grassroots lobbying, and media justice work generates a flood of data, some of which we are currently using to inform our work. So much more is possible.

Support the development and implementation of coding structures, data conventions, and organizational processes to strengthen data quality
Act as the organization’s resource on digital fundraising and SMS best practices by managing the reports and tools that assess key performance indicators and how successfully our programming has been

The ideal candidate will have:
A perspective on how racial and class disparity are apparent throughout technology and data, as well as an eagerness to engage with the team to identify solutions
Commitment to the mission of Color of Change: to help people respond effectively to injustice in the world around us, moving decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more human and less hostile world for Black people in America

Basic familiarity with optimization testing principles; can explain concepts such as random sampling and statistical uncertainty to a non-technical audience.

You are proactive, thorough and skeptical of the data that you report on, validation is a priority for you.

Location: Dallas, TX
Mode Of Hiring: FTE
Job Description:
We want someone who has experience with modern customer (system of record) data modelling. Ideally this experience should be with industry standard data models in a financial services context and cover the main areas of:
Customer Identity – the core identity data elements
Communication Methods – phone, email, physical address
Relationships – between parties
Products and Services – their relationship with the bank’s accounts/services etc.
Preferences – consent, regulatory, privacy, language, solicitation
Demographics – employment, education, income, segmentation
Lifecycle Management – e.g. applicant, prospect, customer, historical customer
But the initial focus areas will be around the high-level customer data model entities i.e. like an MDM solution might have to deal with e.g. the party entity v’s the roles that party plays; with the focus on Customer Identity and Communication Methods since those are the criteria used for match/merge/search. It is important that they have experience building a cloud native database; ideally document based (since we already have people with relational db skills): the challenge isn’t just in modelling how the data is persisted in the database; but also how it is represented in the APIs and events.

Ocean Associates Inc. (OAI) is seeking applicants for a full-time position to provide ecosystem reporting support to the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, within NOAA Fisheries. OAI is a Virginia corporation established in 2003 that provides consulting and technical services to the U.S. government, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and the private sector. We specialize in scientific program and project management, strategic planning, professional and technical services and stakeholder engagement, supporting government contracts.
Description:
NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the conservation and management of our Nation’s living marine resources and their habitats. By developing high quality science and supporting an ecosystem-based approach to management, NMFS provides important services to the Nation, including sustainable fisheries, healthy ecosystems, safe seafood, and protected species recovery.
The U.S. leads the world in sustainable fisheries management; as a result, U.S. fisheries are highly valuable and make large contributions to the U.S. economy. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), NMFS works with the eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) to provide scientific advice on the ~500 federally-managed fish stocks. NMFS stock assessments and other science products are critically important to sustainable fisheries management for assessing the status of fish stocks and predicting future harvest levels, setting sustainable catch limits, and reducing bycatch.
NMFS recently codified its commitment to Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) with the release of their EBFM policy and subsequent EBFM Roadmap. The EBFM Policy establishes a framework of guiding principles to “enhance and accelerate the implementation of EBFM within NOAA Fisheries, and in cooperation with NOAA Fisheries partners.” These guiding principles are: implement ecosystem-level planning, advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, prioritizing vulnerabilities and risk of ecosystems and their components, explore and address trade-offs within an ecosystem, incorporate ecosystem considerations into management advice, and maintain resilient ecosystems.
The Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB) conducts a research program focused on developing ecosystem-level knowledge and advice to support informed decision-making. Research conducted by the Branch encompasses climate science, ecology, process-oriented ecosystem research, and marine population dynamics and ecosystem modeling.
The Branch is responsible for conducting analyses of the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). EDAB also develops and applies ecosystem and statistical models to synthesize information on climate, oceanographic, and human-related pressures. These products are provided to a variety of entities to inform decision-making and to support the implementation of regional and national EBFM. These entities include NOAA, other federal and state agencies, Regional Fishery Management Councils (hereafter, Councils), Marine Fisheries Commissions, research colleagues, nongovernmental organizations, national and international treaty organizations in which the U.S. participates, and the fishing industry (both commercial and recreational).
One of the focal areas of EDAB is Ecosystem Reporting where this position will be focused. The Branch develops several documents reporting ecosystem status and trends (e.g., State of the Ecosystem reports for the two regional councils, Ecosystem Status Report, Current Conditions, Ecosystem Context for Stock Advice, and others). These documents provide climate, environmental, and ecosystem considerations targeted to specific audiences to support individual stock advice, specification setting, and as general communication tools to the general public. Collectively, these documents serve as the backbone of Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs). The reports describe environmental, social, and economic states and their potential impacts on commercially important fish species, protected species, and the NES LME. These synthesis products are important in supporting ecosystem-level advice critical to NMFS, Councils, stakeholders, and other decision-makers.
Data used in ecosystem reporting incorporates a wide range of disciplines. These reports typically contain climate and oceanographic information such as global climate and regional model outputs, satellite sea surface temperature and ocean color data, as well as observations from ongoing hydrographic and plankton surveys. They also contain relevant data from other fisheries independent and dependent sources such as fish and protected species surveys, and commercial landings data. Ecosystem reporting also attempts to capture human dimensions through social and economic data related to Northeast U.S. Coastal communities.
Additionally, the Branch supports a defined process for evaluating and operationalizing new analyses and data for inclusion in ecosystem reporting products to improve generality, accessibility, testing, documentation, and best practices.
Tasks:
The task includes the following:
Coordinate and facilitate implementation of ecosystem reporting projects.Organize and facilitate workshops as needed.
Assist with planning and logistics of program and project team meetings/workshops and help develop agendas, written documents, meeting minutes, presentations, or other materials as required.
Assist with ecosystem data processing and analyses to support the development of ongoing and new ecosystem reporting products.
Assist with the development and maintenance of automated procedures to improve efficiency throughout the ecosystem reporting process (e.g., data collection and processing, report generation, metadata collection).
Assist with the development and maintenance of web interfaces for disseminating ecosystem data and reports.
Ensure adherence to NOAA data policies and Public Access to Research Results guidance.
Prioritize and organize implementation of recommendations from Clients (i.e., Regional Fishery Management Organizations).
Interface between the Information Technology Division (NEFSC/ITD), Clients, and other users to assess needs and develop requirements.
Maintain and update documentation and provide user training on new applications as needed. 1. Communicate the results of projects and activities to general and scientific audiences in written and oral formats.

About Harvest
Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.
Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of almost 90 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.
We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply.
Why We’re Hiring
We are looking for a Data Analyst to uplevel Harvest’s business and product insights, developing reporting and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions throughout the entire Harvest organization.

Synthesize data from a variety of sources to develop and present reporting and data visualizations that drive understanding and inform action for Harvesters at every level of the organization.
Leverage your extensive SQL knowledge to query and analyze data; when more advanced analysis is required, use Python or R to explore, visualize and analyze data while codifying business logic using DBT (Data Build Tool) and automating reports using Mode, our BI tool of choice.
Cultivate a nuanced understanding of Harvest’s data and lead research to uncover the questions we don’t know we should be asking, both for our business and product.
Improve our data systems by collaborating with colleagues across Harvest to continue to expand and centralize our knowledge into DBT while ensuring stakeholders understand how to access this knowledge.
Requirements
Appetite and effort to stay up to date on the latest trends
Strong attention to detail with an analytical mind to problem-solve
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proven ability to visualize data in a way that increases understanding
Ability to work independently with minimal supervision while delivering results
Fluency in SQL and an added benefit if comfortable with a scripting language (preference for Python/R)
Benefits
At Harvest, our compensation consists of three main components:
A competitive base pay: The salary for this role is $165,000 in USD. Every Harvester with the same role expectations receives the same base pay. And we aim to pay at the top of the market (informed by third-party data) for all roles.
Individual and company performance bonus plans: We believe in rewarding performance, so all Harvesters are eligible to receive an individual and company performance bonus after working with Harvest for a period of time.
Competitive benefits*: We offer a number of benefits, including
15 days of vacation in your first year, plus company holidays and a week off for winter break. And you’ll get an additional two days per year until you reach twenty days.

The $16+ trillion market is the backbone of everyday activities that empower financial freedom, from consolidating credit card debt and refinancing student loans, to buying a home and starting a small business.
dv01's data analytics platform brings unparalleled transparency into investment performance and risk for lenders and Wall Street investors in structured products. As a data-first company, we wrangle critical loan data and build modern analytical tools that enable strategic decision-making for responsible lending. In a nutshell, we're helping prevent a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis by offering the data and tools required to make smarter data-driven decisions resulting in a safer world for all of us.
More than 400 of the largest financial institutions use dv01 for our coverage of over 75 million loans spanning mortgages, personal loans, auto, buy-now-pay-later programs, small business, and student loans. dv01 continues to expand coverage of new markets, adding loans monthly, and developing new technologies for the structured products universe.
To get a better idea of what a year at dv01 looks like, check out our 2022 Year in Review page here: https://dv01.co/year-in-review/2022/ If that looks like fun to you, get in touch because we'd love to hear from you.
You Will:
Be on the cutting edge of structured finance and technology. You will be a critical piece in dv01's robust expansion into the capital markets and structured finance space, combining your knowledge with our state-of-the-art technologies.
Expand your structured finance knowledge. You will gain exposure to many facets of the ABS and RMBS spaces, combining information from a variety of sources (loan-level transaction data, deal documents, trustee reporting, etc.) that all flow into dv01's wide range of client offerings.
Enhance your technical skills. You will work closely with engineering teams at dv01 to develop and productize solutions, both for our customers and internally. If you're not already aware of the world that exists outside of Excel for data analysis, you'll become familiar with it very quickly.
Be customer facing. You will directly communicate with contacts at hedge funds, banks, and asset originators, providing valuable reporting and analytics services to assist with their internal processes.
You Are:
Knowledgeable with financial concepts and data. You have experience working with financial data. Experience working with loan-level servicing data and securitizations is preferable, but not required.
Unafraid of large datasets. You are proficient with Excel. You are comfortable either knowing or learning R to perform ad-hoc data analysis, with a desire and ability to grow quickly on the technical front.
Able to separate the financial wheat from the chaff. You are able to identify key metrics and transactional details on financial statements, investor reports, and securitization trustee reports and are not afraid to get your hands dirty by diving into loan-level data.
A focused, detail-oriented, multi-tasker. You love the intricate details of a thorough analysis, but also stay aware of the bigger picture while operating across multiple threads of work. You're able to communicate your findings and opinions internally, as well as with clients.
In good faith our salary range for this role is $75,000 - $80,000 but are not tied to it. Final offer amount will be at the company's sole discretion and determined by multiple factors, including years and depth of experience, expertise, and other business considerations.

Research Scientist,Anthropic,"Hybrid remote in San Francisco, CA 94111","$250,000 - $445,000 a year",/rc/clk?jk=c81131cb07b6005e&fccid=8f0d04a86e31340d&vjs=3,"Note: This is an ""evergreen"" role that we keep open on an ongoing basis. We receive many applications for this position, and you may not hear back from us directly if we do not currently have an open role on any of our teams that matches your skills and experience. We encourage you to apply despite this, as we are continually evaluating for top talent to join our team. You are also welcome to reapply as you gain more experience, but we suggest only reapplying once per year.

You’re excited to work at an organization that functions as a single, cohesive team pursuing large-scale AI research projects. You’re working to align state of the art models with human values and preferences, understand and interpret deep neural networks, or develop new models to support these areas of research. You view research and engineering as two sides of the same coin, and seek to understand all aspects of our research program as well as possible, to maximize the impact of your insights. You have ambitious goals for AI safety and general progress in the next few years, and you’re working to create the best outcomes over the long-term.
You might be a good fit if:
(Required) At least 1 research project related to machine learning in which you played a major role
You can clearly articulate and discuss the motivations behind your work, and teach us about what you've learned.
You like writing up and communicating your results, even when they're null.
You like working on a team and making collaborative, data-driven research decisions.
You believe that a great way to discover a new, big-picture vision is to first get involved in the details.
You have experience doing quantitative science in another field.
How we're different:
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles.
We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're most excited to hire researchers from diverse backgrounds who share this perspective.
We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries.
We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
Annual Salary (USD)
The expected salary range for this position is $250k - $445k.

Hybrid policy: For this role, we prefer candidates who are able to be in our office more than 25% of the time, though we encourage you to apply even if you don’t think you will be able to do that.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.

Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Mulitmodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues."

Learning - Our data and AI products can span a range of applied AI focus areas. From NLP-based solutions to image recognition and processing, the applications are essentially unrestricted. Hence, this role will require an individual with an appetite for (quickly) learning and applying the various techniques needed to address the specific focus area
Communication - Ability to communicate effectively with cross-functional teams, engineers, partners and end-users. Excellent written and verbal communication skills to technical and non-technical audiences. Excellent technical writing and documentation skills
Teamwork - Effective team player who understands the responsibility every individual brings to the table and how to encourage and drive results from each team member
High Performance - Ability to quickly learn new technologies and methodologies to ensure successful and timely completion of product development
Results-oriented - Highly organized and detail-oriented, self-driven and able to adapt to learning and implementing new technologies, and creative in solving issues as they arise

Philanthropic Gift Matching – opportunity for team members to support vulnerable communities, reflecting PJMF’s commitment to social impact
The attributes listed above represent our current thinking for the role. You can be a great candidate even if you don't fit everything we've described below. You can also have important skills we haven't thought of. If that's you - even if you’re on the fence - we encourage you to apply and tell us about yourself!

We have built an environment that celebrates the differences in backgrounds and experiences. PJMF invests in activities that lead to greater inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in how AI and data are conceptualized, developed, applied, and deployed.

Machine Learning Data Engineer,America First Credit Union,"Ogden, UT 84405",,/rc/clk?jk=d8e1d4798ede1759&fccid=aaa155ab940e8e31&vjs=3,"Overview:
The Machine Learning Data Engineer fulfills a foundational role in the modeling workflows and acts as a Data Engineer at AFCU focused on the AFCU machine learning environment. They will work with Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists to generate the needed features to support models within the given SLA's. The Data Engineer will work diligently to check the data quality of those pipelines and set appropriate thresholds to either alert or break a pipeline depending on data quality issues. The Data Engineer also needs to be proactive and identify future features groups that will allow models to utilize additional information about members or accounts to drive the correct decision. The Data Engineer will be the primary stakeholder of the Feature Store, and related technologies to migrate the data to and from it, and responsible for cross-training and maintaining contribution standards and workflows. We expect the Data Engineer to be the core contributor, but not the sole contributor, so workflows should be optimized so that Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can self-serve as much as possible with a heavy focus of protecting the data
model and evolving it in a sustainable way.

We do not build for the sake of building or to pad resumes. Everything is focused on working with a business owner to get the best (balancing complexity and accuracy) model into production and executing, even if that is a decision tree and not a neural network. We put a heavy emphasis on
being able to deploy models into production quickly as a team which includes writing tests, setting up monitoring, and performing code reviews for those data pipelines.

Our culture can be summed up as:

We all love building machine learning/AI systems
We all have a life outside of work
We challenge each other
We prefer common tools and frameworks over niche tools and frameworks
We prefer open source over proprietary, but do value the buy versus build judgement call when it is something we need but do not want as a core competency
We value simplicity over complexity
Always leave the code base better than you found it

What we value most in a team member is someone who can look at a vaguely defined problem and work iteratively in a collaborative fashion to find a concrete clean solution.

In general, the cadence of the team follows agile rituals, however, we do not expect models or their supporting architecture to be completed within a sprint. Being a data focused team, we understand that we do not know the answers, and that modeling can take a lot of twists and turns. So, to aid in
planning and communication we utilize agile rituals but understand that modeling deliverables can be wildly different both in size and time to complete.
Responsibilities:
Communicate.

It all starts and ends with communicating with business stakeholders. The Data Engineer works in a support role as a partner
with Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers to capture more features and expose those for modeling at training and inference time.
A lot of these features come from talking with business stakeholders as the subject matter experts to see how they think and view problems,
as well as Data Scientists as they generate and enhance models. Often the Data Engineer will need to work in an iterative pattern with
stakeholders ambiguous requirements to create concrete requirements to build on top of. The Data Engineer will need to engage with senior

Machine Learning Engineer (Remote),Curai,"Remote in San Francisco Bay Area, CA","$150,000 - $200,000 a year",/rc/clk?jk=247e94f9a28c544f&fccid=9f156dd45bd33047&vjs=3,"Our mission at Curai is to make high-quality healthcare accessible to all. We are fulfilling this audacious mission by building a scalable virtual-first primary care service that provides patients with high-quality care anytime, anywhere, from any device, at a very affordable price, by blending high-touch clinical care and artificial intelligence.

Our company is remote-first and we consider candidates across the United States.

Machine Learning at Curai

We are looking for a Senior ML Engineer to join the machine learning team at Curai. Our team is responsible for Curai’s ML/automation technology and drives the strategy: ML as part of the physician care team will drastically reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of providers. Your work will have a tremendous direct impact on both provider and patient-facing ML-augmented applications, thereby providing low-friction, high-quality care to patients of Curai Health.

We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.

We are excellent collaborators, within our team and across teams with product owners, engineers, and clinicians to deliver automated products for doctors and patients. A successful candidate will own and help engineer end-to-end, AI/ML-powered automated systems in service of better health outcomes at lower costs.

Who You Are

None of these individually are hard requirements, but they do describe the type of folks that we think would be most effective and happy at Curai. You…

Are a self-starter and have a growth mindset.
Have an ownership mentality.
Enjoy tackling complex problems in a scientific and data-driven way.
Thrive in ambiguity and love tackling complex problems that span multiple systems.
Enjoy thinking through trade-offs with mindfulness of near-term needs and Curai’s long-term strategy.
Are collaborative and appreciate working with people with diverse expertise.

What You’ll Do
Design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning models, including those that are based on large language models. These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.
Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.
Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.
Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.

What You’ll Need
“End-to-end” experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.
Experience in natural language processing applications
""Product sense"" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.
Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams. Understanding the mental models of the audience and communicating ideas crisply to this diverse set of stakeholders will be a vital part of the role. You should be comfortable leading cross-functional machine learning product initiatives, from conception to successful product outcomes.
2+ years of industry experience in ML/NLP including building production systems.
